Hello there, I am a former lab scientist that has recently transitioned into the field of IT through my time at Maker's Academy. It's been an intense journey at Maker's, but having recently won a Hackthon even before I had completed the course, I've been more convinced than ever that web development is the path I want to continue on.

I am searching for a Junior Developer position that would allow me to learn and grow my skills as a developer, I am language agnostic but lean towards being able to with full stack. My ideal organization would be one that not only values what I can bring to the table, but also seeks to do good in its business mission.

## Skills

#### Communication
My earliest training in good communication came from working alongside the director of development at a non-profit. From there I gained hands-on experience in drafting press releases, professional correspondence and liaising with outside inquiries and other departments within the organization. One month after I had started I was given the responsibility to oversee a book launch, which included communicating with the author, managing the organization's social media, as well as managing inquiries from the public and event partners.

I have also just started a blog about the job search process after coding bootcamp. You can visit it here.

#### Problem-solving

I am highly experienced in identifying business and systems issues, then working with users and developers to build solutions to these problems.

As a developer this skill enables me to spot and resolve issues before they impact the user experience. For example during the development of the iPhone app Turfy at Makers Academy, I identified that if a user left a game any remaining players would be stuck on the current question. To resolve this I suggested a solution which notified the remaining players that the game had ended, and gave them the option to start a new game.

#### Agile

While the term Agile was a new addition to my vocabulary, I am not unfamiliar with the concept in terms of
