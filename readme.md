Hello there, I am a full-stack developer with experience building web apps using languages such as Ruby, JavaScript, and Swift 3. Formerly trained as a lab scientist, I've transitioned into web development through Makers Academy's Web Development course. It's been an intense journey at Makers, but having recently won a Hackthon even before I had completed the course, I believe I have the necessary skill set for a Junior Developer position. My ideal organization would be one that practices pair programming, TDD, and Agile.

Since finishing Makers I have been involved in Atticus Portal, a startup that aims to improve access to justice for all in the UK. The platform aims to partner with Law Centres in the UK to streamline the process of drop-in sessions. The product is still work in progress, but you can check it out [here](http://atticus-portal.co.uk).
## Skills

#### Communication

My earliest training in good communication came from working alongside the director of development at American Academy in Rome. At this post I gained hands-on experience in drafting press releases, professional correspondence and liaising with outside inquiries and other departments within the organization. One month after I had started I was given the responsibility to oversee a book launch, which included communicating with the author, managing the organization's social media, as well as managing inquiries from the public and event partners.

#### Problem-solving

Working in real estate development meant that one has to always expect the unexpected, and that includes anything from changes in customer's requirements to foundation issues that required us to return to the drawing board.
While the scenarios all differ, in the end they all demand a can-do attitude and exploring all the options to make an informed decision. I was able to apply my problem-solving skills at Makers when writing user stories, so as to better create a product that meets the customer's needs.

#### Analysis

In the past I have always been able to apply my existing knowledge to learning a new concept. I did my bachelors in nutrition and masters degrees in heritage science, both interdisciplinary fields. During the interview for my masters program I was able to demonstrate my biochemistry knowledge and impressed the admission panel. The masters also emphasized on individual research, which for me entailed meticulous and regimented data sampling for my experiment, as well as interpreting the findings alongside existing literature to draw convincing conclusions.
